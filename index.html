    I am a computer Engineer, father of an awesome son, husband of strange and great wife.

    After spending years doing engineering at some companies I had decided to stop and tried to do my own thing, that's why I was also a founder of start-up technology company where we developed a new platform for video delivery using P2P technology called PCDN.IO, but it <b>fail</b>. So currently I am Head of engineering for an online payment product. My job is managing day to day task of our funny teams, a bit of coding, doing some code review and debate all day long.
