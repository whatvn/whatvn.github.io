title: About me
---

I am a computer Engineer, a father of an awesome son, a husband of strange and great wife. 

After spending years doing engineering at some companies I had decided to stop and tried to do my own thing, that's why I was also a founder of start-up technology company where we developed a new platform for video delivery using P2P technology called PCDN.IO, but it **fail**. So currently I am a Engineer Leader for an online payment product. My job is managing day to day task of our funny team, a litle bit of coding, doing some code review and debate all day long. 

This blog is where my interesting (and sometimes hated) things will be noted.
