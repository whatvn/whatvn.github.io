---

I am a computer Engineer who mostly work on Linux software and things. I was a founder of start-up company where we develop a new platform for video delivery using P2P technology called PCDN.IO. 

Currently I am working as Engineer Leader for an online payment product. My job is manage day to day task of people, a litle bit of coding, code review and debate all day long. This blog is where my interesting (and sometimes hated) things will be noted.
